## Hi there! I'm Oleksandr â€” aka sqdshguy ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who is excited about creating projects that address real-world problems and add value, whether they are little utilities or large-scale systems. My focus is always on creating ideas that are both impactful and profitable.

What I'm currently working on:

* Using Rust to improve application performance and reliability
* Integrating AI technologies for increased productivity, faster learning, and better solutions.
* Creating innovative projects with tangible business value 
* Bringing extensive blockchain and cryptocurrency experience to EVM chains, TON, and Solana

I enjoy working at the meeting point of technology and problem-solving, and I'm constantly searching for opportunities to develop things that have an impact. I'd love to connect with you if you're working on something ambitious and significant.
